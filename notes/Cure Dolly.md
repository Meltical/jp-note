- **で** = Where / With what
- **の** = possessive marker (of)

### Non-Logical Particles

## Adjectives

### い adjectives

### Verbs as adjectives

All verbs can be adjectives, even if conjugated.

The girl sang = 女の子が[歌]{うた}った

=> The girl who sang ... = 歌った女の子が。。。

### Noun as adjectives

Noun + **な** (きれいな川)

Noun + **の** (ぜるだのでんせつ) (Zelda's legend = Legend of Zelda)

## Negatives

When we say we are not doing something, we are using the adjective **ない**

There is no pen = ぺんがない
This is not a pen = これはぺん**では**ない

The **で** is the **て** form of the verb **だ** (to be). We add the topic flag **は** and attach the **ない** adjective.

### Verbs: あ stem + ない

| Ending | Negative |
| --- | --- |
| **う** | **わ** |
| く | か |
| す | さ |
| つ | た |
| ぬ | な |
| ふ | は |
| む | ま |
| る | ら |

### い adjective : く + ない

かわい**い** => かわい**くない**

### Past tense

Since **ない** is an adjective, we can conjugate it to the past tense.
To do so, we need to change the **い** to **かった**.
This way we can conjugate the adjective AND the verbs.

かわい**くなかった** = Was not cute <br>
私がはしら**なかった** = I did not run

### Irregular

| Positive | Negative |
| --- | --- |
| ます (Formality helper-verb) | ません |
| いい | よくない |

## に Particle

The に particle is used to describe the **target of an action**

> Physical: Destination, location

お店**に** 行く = Go **to the store**

(へ particle means to **head** to.)

> Emotional: Volitional target

たまごを かい**に** 行く = Go **to buy** eggs

In the same phrase, we can have 2 or more targets, like:

お店**に** たまごを かい**に** 行く = Go **to the store**...**to buy** eggs

> Transformation

さくらは　かえる**に**　なった = Sakura **became** a frog

ことし　十八さい**に**　なる = This year, I **will be** 18 years old

## Desire (たい・がる)

To describe a desire, we can use the helper adjective **たい** to the い-stem of the verb.

私は　ケーキを　たべ**たい** = (Literally) As for me, cake is desire-inducing (eat)

We can't affirm desire for someone else, but we can use the helper verb **がる**.

- For verbs, we need to use the **～たい form**, to which we add the **がる** helper verb. => **たがる**

さくらは　けーきが　たべ**たがる** = As for Sakure, cake is eat-want-inducing

- For adjectives, we need to use the **い-stem** and add **がる**

さくらは　けーきが　ほし**がる** = As for Sakure, cake is want-inducing

## Potential え-stem + る/られる

私は　本が　[読]{よ}め**る** = To me, the book is read-able

私は　ケーキが　たべ**られる** = To me, the cake is eat-able

**Irregulars:**
| Verb | Potential |
| --- | --- |
| する | できる |
| [来]{く}る | [来]{こ}られる |

## Giving / Receiving

When we want to say that we do something for someon, we use the て-form of the action verb + **あげる** (To give upwards because we are always below):

> 私が　お姉さんに　本を　**読んであげる** = I read a book for my older sister

When we receive, we use **くれる**:

> お姉さんが　私に　本を　**読んでくれる** = I have my older sister read a book for me

We can do the same thing with **もらう** but the emphasis different:

| Verb | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **くれる** | she does something for me (her action emphasized) |
| **もらう** | I receive something from her (my perspective emphasized) |

## [物]{もの} vs [事]{こと}

| [物]{もの} | [事]{こと} |
| --- | --- |
| Physical object | Abstract object |

## と Particle

Turns anything "quoted" before it, into a single noun.

> [彼女]{かのじょ}は「[本]{ほん}が[好]{す}き」と[言]{い}った。

と+する means "enacting the action of the verb". Often used with the volitional form, meaning "to try to do something".

> やまに　のぼろう　とする = To do (try) "Let's climb the mountain" = To try to climb the mountain

## Receptive あ-stem + れる/られる

> Receive or get.

さくらが　しか**ら**　**れた** = Sakura got scolded

みずが　の**ま**　**れた** = Water got drunk

さくらは　だれかに　かばんが　めす**ま**　**れた** = As for Sakura, a bag got stolen by someone

さくらが　だれかに　かばんを　めす**ま**　**れた** = Sakura got her bag stolen by someone

## Self-move / Other-move

A self move verb is a verb that indicates that the subject is doing the action to itself.

An other-move verb is a verb that indicates that the subject is doing the action to something else.

> [出]{で}る = to leave (self-move) <br> [出]{だ}す = to take out (other-move)

| Self | Other |
| --- | --- |
| **ある** | **する** |
| ～あ-stem + る | ～す・～せる |
| ～む | ～める |
| ～ぶ | ～べる |
| ～つ | ～てる |

## Causative あ-stem + せる/させる

Cause someone to do something.

> いぬ**を**　たべ　**させた** = I caused the dog to eat

We can use を or に to indicate the target of the action.

But we cannot use を more than once in the same sub-clause.

> いぬ**に**　にく**を**　たべ　**させた** = I caused the dog to eat meat

## Causative-receptive あ-stem + せられる/させられる

Get-made to do something.

> 私は　ケーキを　たべた = I ate the cake

> ケーキは　私に　たべられた = The cake was eaten by me

> 父は　私に　ケーキを　たべさせた = My father caused me to eat the cake

> 私は　父に　ケーキを　たべさせられた = I was made to eat the cake by my father

It's easier to understand if we think of who is doing the action and who is receiving it.

"I was made to eat the cake" clearly indicates that I am the one doing the action of "receiving caused to eat" by my father.

## こ・そ・あ・ど

| Location Word | れ (Pronoun) | の (Possessive) | な (Comparing Adjectival) | ～う・～あ Extended (Describing actions) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ここ (here) | これ (this) | この (this-smth) | こんな (Like this) | こう (In this way) |
| そこ (there) | それ (that) | その (that-smth) | そんな (Like that) | そう (In that way) |
| あそこ (over there) | あれ (that over there) | あの (that-smth) | あんな (Like that) | ああ (In that way) |
| どこ (where) | どれ (which) | どの (How-described) | どんな (Like what ?) | どう (How / In what way ?) |

## て～いる・て～ある・て～あく

### 1. ～ている (te-iru)

This form is used to express:

- Ongoing actions: **今、テレビを　見ている。** (I am watching TV now.)
- Resultant states from past actions: **結婚　している。** (I am married.)
- Habitual actions: **毎朝　ジョギングを　している。** (I jog every morning.)

> Verb in て-form + いる

---

### 2. ～てある (te-aru)

Used to describe the **state that remains after a purposeful action has been completed**. Often used for objects being prepared or set.

- **まどが　開けて　ある。** (The door has been opened [by someone] and remains open.)

> Transitive verb in て-form + ある  
> (Implies intentionality and result)

Here the subject is **being** opened. The **window** is **being** opened.

---

### 3. ～ておく (te-oku)

[置く]{おく} means "to put" or "to place". The form ～ておく is used to express the idea of placing something in a certain state
おく is
Expresses the

- **私がは　窓を　開けて　おく**　 (I put the window in state of being opened.)

> Verb in て-form + おく  
> (Can also contract to ～とく in casual speech)

Here the subject is **putting** something in a certain state.
**I** am **putting** the window in a state of being opened.

## ～という

という is used to quote something, like a name or a title.
Some abreviations of という are:

- **ていう**: アニメ**というものは**面白いね。
- **っていう**: アニメ**っていう**面白いね。
- **って**: アニメ**って**面白いね。

> “The thing called anime is interesting, huh.”

## だって

### Someone said (だ＋という)

(／が)　明日は　[晴]{は}れだ　**って** = Tomorrow is sunny, they said.

---

### But/Because (だ＋って)

When we use だって, or ですね in response of a sentence, we are acknowledging the information and adding something to it.

> A：　きれいな　かわ　です　！　B：　ですね　！

Here B is implying : (ほんとう)　ですね　！

> B：　だから。。。

Here B is implying: From fact A, ...

> A：　さくらが　きれい　だね　！　B：　だって　[頭]{あたま}が　[弱]{よは}い。

> A: Sakura is beautiful, huh! B: You said that, but she is not smart."

The だ in だって acknowledges the information, and the って adds a nuance of "you said that, but...".
But it does not mean litterally "but", more like "you said that, but I have something to add in contradiction".

**だって has a slightly negative nuance, and childish tone.**

---

### Even I / Say it's me

> さくらが　できる = Sakura can do it

> 私だって　できる = Even I can do it

In this context, it means "Even I can do it", as in "It's not that hard".

Without context 「私だって　できる」mean "Even I say I can do it", without sounding negative.

# Likeliness / Conjecture そう　→　らしい・っぽい　→　ようだ・みたい・まるで

## そう (Seems like or Hearsay)

### Seems like

> Noun : 元気**そうな**　子供　(From 元気な)
> Seems like a healthy child

> Verb : 雨が　**[降]{ふ}りそう**だ (From [降]{ふ}る)
> Seems like it will rain

> Adjective : おいし**そう** (From おいしい)
> Looks delicious

---

### Hearsay

After a complete sentence, we can add そうだ or そうです

> さくらが　にほんじんだ　**そうだ** = I heard that Sakura is Japanese.

## らしい (Subjective quality)

**Fun fact: ~しい Adjectives are used to decribe subjective qualities.**

> おいしい・むずかしい・たのしい

We can use **らしい** two ways:

1. After a word, giving it a subjective quality.

> 彼は　[日本人]{にほんじん}らしい = He seems like a Japanese person

2. After a sentence, indicating that the statement itself is subjective (deduction/hearsay..).

> 彼は　[日本人]{にほんじん}らしい = I heard that he is Japanese

**～っぽい** is also used like らしい, but it is more casual and only attached to a word.

---

Exemple:

子供**らしい** is more likely to imply the child's behaving in a way proper to a child.

子供**っぽい** tends to mean childish.

## ようだ・みたい・まるで

**まるで** means "roundly" / "wholy" = "completely" / "entirely".

It is an hyperbolic expression that signals the coming of a metaphor.

> **This is why it can't bet used with そう or らしい**

ex: [まるで]{Completly}　[ゆうれい]{a ghost}を　[見た]{seen}　[か]{if}　**のような**　[顔]{face}をした

Here **か** transforms the logical sentence into a noun (as a question, an "if").

This is why we can use **の**ような, since we can only attach **の** to nouns.

- 山**のようだ** : noun
- 山**のような**人 : adjectival noun
- 風**のように**はしる : adverb

---

みたい is used the same way as ようだ, but it is more casual.

- 山**みたいだ** : noun
- 山**みたいな**人 : adjectival noun
- 風**みたいに**はしる : adverb

よう means a "form" or a "likeness".

## ばかり (だ・です)

Attached to a completed action, it means "Just" or "Nothing but"

> 来た　ばかり = I just came

> 甘い物　ばかりだ = There's only but sweet things

After the て-form, it means "Doing nothing but x"

> 泣いて　ばかり = Crying all the time

Using ばかり**か** as a "if", meaning changes to : ... not only but also ..

> うたった　ばかりか　おどった = Not only did I sing, but I also danced

Using ばかり**に**, it means "Only because of"

> みみが　大きい　ばかりに、だれも　あそんで　くれない = Only because I have big ears, no one plays with me

## Becoming ように・ことに

### ように

When using **ように** after a logical clause, we are saying that "form" of the logical clause is the target of the action.

It is often used with

- **なる**: to indicate becoming something.

> 彼を　信じる　ように　なった = I have come to believe him.

- **する**: to indicate to make something enter a state.

> 彼女は　よく見える　ように　する = To make her look good.

Since it has a meaning of state, when we say ドアを閉めるようにしてください, it means "Please **make it so the door is in the state of being closed**".

Also, we can use it to indicate a **wish or a desire**. 毎日歩くようにする = To make it so I walk every day.

Sometimes we omit する like when wishing for something to happen.

日本に　行きます　ように (してください) = I wish to go to Japan

- Any action or sentence. To describe how the logical clause is done.

> 彼女は　よく見える　ように　口べにを　[付]{つ}ける = To make her look good, she put on lipstick.

---

### ことに

**ことに**する・**ことに**なる function similarly to ように in that they express changes in state or decisions:

- ことに**する**: The speaker intentionally decides to do something (volitional).

- ことに**なる**: A situation has been decided or changed without the speaker’s direct involvement (non-volitional).

# Conditionals

## と Conditional Exclusive

As seen before, と is the "exclusive and".

> 冬になる　と、寒くなる = When it becomes winter, it will get cold.

=> There is no other possibility than it getting cold. it is **Exclusive**

> それを　たべる　と、　病気に　なる = If you eat that, you will get sick.

=> Eating that and the only outcome is getting sick. It is an hyperbolic statement.

> 行けない　と、　ダメ = If you can't go, it's bad.

=> You don't go and it'll be bad. = Run!!!

In all these cases, the と particle is used to indicate a **certain outcome** of an action. We could translate it as "If" or "When", but it is absolute and exclusive.

## ば・れば Conditional

Attaches to the **え-stem**.

| Source | Conditional |
| --- | --- |
| する | すれば |
| くる | くれば |
| Ichidan: たべる | 　たべれば |
| Godan: かく | 　かけば |
| Adjectives: おもしろい | おもしろければ |
| Negative: ない | なければ |

> どうそればいい = How should I act will be good ?

> 勉強しなければ　いけない = If I don't study, It won't do.

## たら・なら Conditional

たら is formed on the past tense of a word.

Event A must happen before event B. => Aたら、B

Since event A will happen, we can use it to say "When A, then B"

> にほんにいったら、　おみやげをかう = When I go to Japan, I will buy a souvenir.

なら is used with the plain form of a word.

If you are thinking of doing A, then B. => Aなら、B

Most versatile one :

> [I will go] それなら、　私もいく = If that's the case, I will go too.

> にほｎにくるなら、　おしえてね。 = If you come to Japan, let me know.

> さくらなら、できるよ。 = If it's Sakura, she can do it.

## Setting the limit

Ordered from the most limiting to the least limiting (a little -> neutral -> a lot)

1. **しか** = no more than (in negative sentences)

> １０００円しか　ない = I have only 1000 yen. (I don't have more than 1000 yen)

2. **だけ** = limit / **のみ** = only (more formal)

> １０００円**だけ**　ある = I have only 1000 yen. (1000 yen is the limit that I have)

> できる**だけ**　勉強します = I will study as much as possible (I will study to the **limit of my ability**)

3. **ばかり** = only (Hyperbolic, can mean "a lot")

## より・ほう (一方)

**より** = from (A<B)

> メアリーよりさくらはきれいだ = Sakura is prettier than Mary.

**ほう** = direction / side

> さくらのほうがきれいだ = Sakura is prettier (than Mary).

**[一方]{いっぽう}** = one side. At the start of a sentence, it means "On one side" or "On the other side".

> 彼は勉強が好きな一方、私はゲームが好きです。= He likes studying, on the other hand, I like games.

## Place

Physical place : **[所]{ところ}**

Can also mean "time" or "state" :

-　さくらの**どこ**が好きですか？ = What do you like about Sakura?

- [昼]{ひる}ご[飯]{はん}を　たべる　**ところ**だ = I am at the place where I eat lunch.　=> Immediate action

- [昼]{ひる}ご[飯]{はん}を　たべた　**ところ**だ = I just ate lunch.

> We can ommit ろ・ど from the **とこ(ろだ)**

## Adjectival nouns

- な
- の
- なる (のある) = かれい -> **なる**　たんてい
- たる = らんらん **たる** <- め

## か Particle

Putting the か particle at the end of a formal sentence, turns it into a question.

Putting the か particle after a casual sentence makes it blunt or rude.

> さくらが　来る**か**　分からない = I don't know if Sakura will come.

**かどうか** = Whether or not

> さくらが　来る**かどうか**　分からない = I don't know whether or not Sakura will come.

In the middle of a sentence, it means "or".

> お茶**か**　コーヒー　がいい？ = Do you want tea or coffee?

物ですか = Is it a thing?　For short, もんか

It is a rude way to say "No way!" or "As if!"

> 俺が　負ける**もんか** = No way I will lose!

## で / だ

**で** is the て-form of the copula **だ**.

- As an order

When we use the て-form of a verb, we are often shortening てください.

So we can say, お元気**で** = Be well (Please be well) -> お元気だ as an order.

- As a connecting form

無事**で**　よかった = I am glad that you are safe.

## が as "but"

The subject particle **が** can only be used after a noun.

When we use が after a complete sentence, it means "but".

> お店は　いったが　パンが　なかった = I went to the store, but there was no bread.

At the end of a sentence, it can be used as a softener, to make a statement less direct.

> コーヒーが　欲しいが = I want coffee (but... if you don't have any, that's okay).

## に as "and"

The particle **に** can be used to connect two nouns, meaning "and".

## 3 types of nouns

| Type | Notes | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adjectival Noun | Can use the な particle | **きれいな**川 |
| する Noun | Can add する to transform into a verb | 勉強**する** -> 勉強が好きです |
| Adverbial Noun | Can drop に or と | ゆっくりにする -> ゆっくりする |

More on Adverbial nouns:

- あまり: Excess

  > 悲しみの**あまり**泣いた = I cried from excess sadness

- [随分]{ずいぶん}: Sufficiently
  > 彼は　**随分**　勉強した = He studied sufficiently

## まま (Unchanged state)

> [自然]{しぜん}のままの[森]{もり} = A forest in its natural state

> そのまま食べられる？ = Can you eat it as is?

We often see it used with 思い -> Meaning "as the unchanged thoughts" :

> 思いのまま = As you wish (lit. as your thoughts are)

> 思いのままに動けない = I can't move as I wish (lit. I can't move as my thoughts are)

## Casual japanese : ちゃう・ちゃった

**ちゃう** is a casual contraction of **てしまう**.

しまう means "to finish" or "to complete".

We can translate it as "It's done", as something accidentally happened, or something regrettable happened etc..

> しまった = Lit. "That's the end" = "Damn it!"
