## Adjectives

### い adjectives

### Verbs as adjectives

All verbs can be adjectives, even if conjugated.

The girl sang = 女の子が[歌]{うた}った

=> The girl who sang ... = 歌った女の子が。。。

### Noun as adjectives

Noun + **な** (きれいな川)

Noun + **の** (ぜるだのでんせつ) (Zelda's legend = Legend of Zelda)

## Negatives

When we say we are not doing something, we are using the adjective **ない**

There is no pen = ぺんがない
This is not a pen = これはぺん**では**ない

The **で** is the **て** form of the verb **だ** (to be). We add the topic flag **は** and attach the **ない** adjective.

### Verbs: あ stem + ない

| Ending | Negative |
| --- | --- |
| **う** | **わ** |
| く | か |
| す | さ |
| つ | た |
| ぬ | な |
| ふ | は |
| む | ま |
| る | ら |

### い adjective : く + ない

かわい**い** => かわい**くない**

### Past tense

Since **ない** is an adjective, we can conjugate it to the past tense.
To do so, we need to change the **い** to **かった**.
This way we can conjugate the adjective AND the verbs.

かわい**くなかった** = Was not cute <br>
私がはしら**なかった** = I did not run

### Irregular

| Positive | Negative |
| --- | --- |
| ます (Formality helper-verb) | ません |
| いい | よくない |

## に Particle

The に particle is used to describe the **target of an action**

> Physical: Destination, location

お店**に** 行く = Go **to the store**

(へ particle means to **head** to.)

> Emotional: Volitional target

たまごを かい**に** 行く = Go **to buy** eggs

In the same phrase, we can have 2 or more targets, like:

お店**に** たまごを かい**に** 行く = Go **to the store**...**to buy** eggs

> Transformation

さくらは　かえる**に**　なった = Sakura **became** a frog

ことし　十八さい**に**　なる = This year, I **will be** 18 years old

## Desire (たい・がる)

To describe a desire, we can use the helper adjective **たい** to the い-stem of the verb.

私は　ケーキを　たべ**たい** = (Literally) As for me, cake is desire-inducing (eat)

We can't affirm desire for someone else, but we can use the helper verb **がる**.

- For verbs, we need to use the **～たい form**, to which we add the **がる** helper verb. => **たがる**

さくらは　けーきが　たべ**たがる** = As for Sakure, cake is eat-want-inducing

- For adjectives, we need to use the **い-stem** and add **がる**

さくらは　けーきが　ほし**がる** = As for Sakure, cake is want-inducing

## Potential え-stem + る/られる

私は　本が　[読]{よ}め**る** = To me, the book is read-able

私は　ケーキが　たべ**られる** = To me, the cake is eat-able

**Irregulars:**
| Verb | Potential |
| --- | --- |
| する | できる |
| [来]{く}る | [来]{こ}られる |

## Giving / Receiving

When we want to say that we do something for someon, we use the て-form of the action verb + **あげる** (To give upwards because we are always below):

> 私が　お姉さんに　本を　**読んであげる** = I read a book for my older sister

When we receive, we use **くれる**:

> お姉さんが　私に　本を　**読んでくれる** = I have my older sister read a book for me

We can do the same thing with **もらう** but the emphasis different:

| Verb | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **くれる** | she does something for me (her action emphasized) |
| **もらう** | I receive something from her (my perspective emphasized) |

## [物]{もの} vs [事]{こと}

| [物]{もの} | [事]{こと} |
| --- | --- |
| Physical object | Abstract object |

## と Particle

Turns anything "quoted" before it, into a single noun.

> [彼女]{かのじょ}は「[本]{ほん}が[好]{す}き」と[言]{い}った。

と+する means "enacting the action of the verb". Often used with the volitional form, meaning "to try to do something".

> やまに　のぼろう　とする = To do (try) "Let's climb the mountain" = To try to climb the mountain

## Receptive あ-stem + れる/られる

> Receive or get.

さくらが　しか**ら**　**れた** = Sakura got scolded

みずが　の**ま**　**れた** = Water got drunk

さくらは　だれかに　かばんが　めす**ま**　**れた** = As for Sakura, a bag got stolen by someone

さくらが　だれかに　かばんを　めす**ま**　**れた** = Sakura got her bag stolen by someone

## Self-move / Other-move

A self move verb is a verb that indicates that the subject is doing the action to itself.

An other-move verb is a verb that indicates that the subject is doing the action to something else.

> [出]{で}る = to leave (self-move) <br> [出]{だ}す = to take out (other-move)

| Self | Other |
| --- | --- |
| **ある** | **する** |
| ～あ-stem + る | ～す・～せる |
| ～む | ～める |
| ～ぶ | ～べる |
| ～つ | ～てる |

## Causative あ-stem + せる/させる

Cause someone to do something.

> いぬ**を**　たべ　**させた** = I caused the dog to eat

We can use を or に to indicate the target of the action.

But we cannot use を more than once in the same sub-clause.

> いぬ**に**　にく**を**　たべ　**させた** = I caused the dog to eat meat

## Causative-receptive あ-stem + せられる/させられる

Get-made to do something.

> 私は　ケーキを　たべた = I ate the cake

> ケーキは　私に　たべられた = The cake was eaten by me

> 父は　私に　ケーキを　たべさせた = My father caused me to eat the cake

> 私は　父に　ケーキを　たべさせられた = I was made to eat the cake by my father

It's easier to understand if we think of who is doing the action and who is receiving it.

"I was made to eat the cake" clearly indicates that I am the one doing the action of "receiving caused to eat" by my father.
